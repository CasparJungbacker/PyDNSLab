# PyDNSLab

This is (going to be) a Python version of Vuorinen & Keskinen's DNSLab [[1]](#1), orignally written for Matlab. **I'm just doing this for fun, so I will not make any guarantees**. The goal is to create a DNS package that is purely written in Python, and uses a minimal amount of packages. This will be done by making extensive use of Numpy and SciPy, and possibly Numba.
